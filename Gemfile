# Run `bundle exec guard`
# In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work,
# if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems
# that conflict with your bundle. However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain.
# Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.

# Note that "~>" means the last digit in the version number is allowed to go up
# It's much like '1.0.X'
# If you have 1.0.0 and a version 1.0.1 of a gem is released, it will grab that version
# In other words, it will update to the next minor release but not a major release
