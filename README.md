# Skimpy Slate

**This project is in the very early stages of development. It is not ready to use.**

Skimpy will provide basic blog functionality without the use of a database but it is **not** a static site generator.

Features will include:
* Basic routing to posts and pages
* Twig templating
* Post archives
* Out of the box contact form

## Set up
* Clone this repo
* Clone [jtallant/skimpy](https://github.com/jtallant/skimpy) into the vendor directory. Make sure the dir name is just skimpy.

[jtallant/skimpy](https://github.com/jtallant/skimpy) isn't loaded through composer because it's in such early development there is no point in publishing it. It is easier to develop on it without having to commit then composer update.

## TODO
* Move the archive routing code into skimpy
* Tests
* A whole bunch of other stuff

## Notes
* The composer.json file will probably look something like this after the project is ready for initial release.

Skimpy Slate will be a template for a blog, and skimpy will provide the actual functionality.

They will be two separate composer packages.
